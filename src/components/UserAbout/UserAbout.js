        Hi, I am Aditya, currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science.
        I love learning new technologies. Android, Web Development and Algorithms fascinate me.
        I am passionate about what I do and always give my 100%.
        When I undertake a project or task, I don't just complete it,
        I go the extra mile and make it better than requested.
